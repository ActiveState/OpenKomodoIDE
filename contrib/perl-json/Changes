Revision history for Perl extension JSON.

## JSON version 2.xx #####################################################

In this version, JSON was totally rewritten.

  * JSON becomes a wrapper to JSON::XS or JSON::PP!
  * objToJson() and jsonToObj() are obsoleted!
  * $JSON::* variables are no longer available!
  * JSON::Parser and JSON::Converter are deleted from the distribution!
  * JSONRPC* and Apache::JSONRPC are deleted from the distribution!
     Please check JSON::RPC (supports JSON-RPC protocol v1.1 and 1.0).

##########################################################################

 !! Since 2.16, PP's relaxed option caused an infinite loop in some condition.
 !! Recommend to update old versions.

2.08  Sat Apr 12 22:49:39 2008
	[JSON]
	- fixed JSON::Boolean inheritance mechanism.
            If the backend is XS with support_by_pp mode and using PP only
            support method, JSON::Boolean did not work correctly.
            Thanks to hg[at]apteryx's point.

	[JSON::PP] 2.07
