0.9.1
- Fixed incorrent stack calculation.
- Context#stop_next= method aliased as Context#step.
- Added the 'force' parameter to Context#step_over.
- Added the 'force' parameter to Context#step.
- 'next+/step+' commands forces to move to another line
- Added a new 'forcestep' setting.

0.9
- Kernel#debugger method will start the debugger if it's not running.
- Added Context#stop_reason method.
- Calling a method with a block will create a new frame. This changes the behavior of 'next' command. So in order to step into a block, 'step' command must be used. That fixes bug #9629.
- Added the possibility to add a temporary context-specific breakpoint. Context#breakpoint and Context#set_breakpoint methods are added. 
- 'cont' command now accepts a numerical parameter which implements 'Continue until line' behavior.
- Added new Context.frame_class method
- Added new 'framefullpath' setting.
- Added new 'frameclassname' setting.
- All Ruby's 'eval' and require/load methods create a new frame. Fixes bug #9686.

0.8.1
- Added a shortcut module 'debugger'. require "ruby-debug/debugger" will start the debugger and stop at the next line (similar to require 'debug').
- Fixed remote debugging.

0.8
- Extract the base debugger API into a separate gem (ruby-debug-base), so it will be easier to add a new interface.
- Added 'set autoirb' setting.
- Bugfixes.

0.7.5
- Fixed 'reload on' command
- 'reload on' command is removed in favor of 'set autoreload'
- rdebug will evaluate ~/.rdebugrc script on startup

0.7.4
- Added a workaround of the Ruby interpreter problem where a method created with Module#define_method 
  and which raises an exception doesn't trigger a :return event, this way screwing the stack trace.
- Fixed a situation of an array 'out of bounds' access.
- Fixed the help for 'where' command.

0.7.3
- Fixed a case when a frame is not popped up properly.
- Removed Context.ignore= method, since it can result with the segmentation fault error.
- Fixed the case when Context#suspend may effect the state of the thread on Context#resume
- Fixed several cases of seg faults when accessing dyna_vars structure.

0.7.2
- Fixed Context#resume (a thread should be waked up only when it was running when it was suspended).
- When handling post-mortem exception, all threads must be suspended.

0.7.1
- Fixed 'delete' command

0.7
- Eliminated explicit Frame object. Use Context.frame_[binding,file,line] instead.
- Fixed help command.
- Renamed Debugger.keep_frame_info to Debugger.keep_frame_binding
- 'eval' command is available, even when keep_frame_binding is not used.
- New 'set' command is available.

0.6.2
- Added thread lookup cache.
- Control thread is always started by rdebug script.
- Ability to specify negative frame number to frame commands. Patch from R. Bernstein.

0.6.1
- Another performance optimization.

0.6
- Added option to exclude collecting of frame bindings.
- Several performance optimizations.

0.5.4
- Added -x/--trace option to rdebug script. Patch from R. Bernstein.
- Removed a live thread reference from the context's structure avoiding memory leakage.

0.5.3
- Added Module#post_mortem_method method, which wraps any method with Debugger.post_mortem block.
- Added breakpoint id, which is not dependent on the breakpoint position in Debugger.breakpoints array.

0.5.2
- Fixes interoperability problems with rspec.
- Made 'exit' as an alias to 'quit'
- Added 'restart' command. Patch from R. Bernstein.

0.5.1
- Bugfixes.

0.5
- Added post-mortem debugging
- Added 'irb' command.

0.4.5
- Fixed debug_method when applied to setter.
- Added 'reload' command which can be used to reload source code in case it's been changed.
- Added Debugger.reload_source_on_change option (true, by default) which controls whether ruby-debug should keep
  track of the source files modification times and reload them if they've been changed.

0.4.4
- Renamed Context#set_suspend and Context#clear_suspend methods to Context#suspend and Context#resume respectively.
- Context#resume method not only clears suspend flag, but also resumes the thread execution.
- Bugfixes.

0.4.3
- Added Debugger.skip method which allows escaping a block from the debugger reach.
- Bugfixes.

0.4.2
- Module#deubg_method added.
- Added rdoc.
- Bugfixes.

0.4.1
- New binding_n method for Kernel module.
- Bugfixes.

0.4 
- Debugger.start method takes a block. If a block is specified, this method starts debugger, yields to the block
  and stops debugger at the end.
- 'tm[ate]' command accepts a frame number now.
- 'list' command accepts on/off parameter which controls whether listing will be displayed on every stop.
- 'eval on/off' controls the evaluation of unknown command.
- Debugger reads readline history file .rdebug_hist at startup and saves it at exit.
- 'sa[ve] <file>' command can be used to save current breackpoints and catchpoint if any
- 'sc[ript] <file>' command can be used to run script file. Script files can contain only control commands.
- rdebug script accepts '--script FILE' parameter.
- thread commands are available for the control port.

0.3 (2006-08-07)
- Renamed Debugger.start_server to Debugger.start_remote.
- Debugger.start_remote activates debugger by calling Debugger.start.
- Debugger.start_remote starts a control thread which listen on port 8990 and accepts control 
  commands, such as adding/deleting breakpoints, assigning catchpoint, etc. (Useful for GUI integration)
- New Debugger.wait_connection option. When it's true, Debugger.start_remote waits until
  a remote connection is made.
- New Debugger.stop_on_connect option. When a remote connection is established, debugger
  stops the main thread (Thread.main).
- 'interrupt' command is available for the control thread.

0.2.1 (2006-07-29)
- 'f[rame] nn' command selects a numbered frame. Frame numbers can be obtained by running frame 
  command without parameters.
- 'l[ist] =' show code in the context of the current line.
- 'tm[ate]' opens the current file in TextMate. Available only on Mac OSX. 

0.2 (2006-07-17)
- Added the remote debugging. It should be activated by calling Debugger#start_server method.
- CHANGED: In order to activate the debugger, it's not enough to require 'ruby-debug'. 
  Debugger#start method must be called explicitly.
- Debugger used to evaluate anything you enter as long as it's not a command. Starting from
  this version the 'eval' command must be used to evaluate an expression.

0.1.5 (2006-07-13)
- Now the check for a  breakpoint uses base filename of the source file.
- Removed compilation warnings when compiling with -Wall

0.1.4 (2006-07-12)
- Remembers the previous command. Invoke it by typing a carriage return
  at the command prompt.

0.1.3 (2006-07-11)
- Conditional breakpoints
- Bugfixes

0.1.2 (2006-07-16)
========================

- Initial release.
